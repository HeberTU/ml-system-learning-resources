## Machine Learning Systems Design
- **Books**
  - [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/) by Chip Huyen This book offers a holistic perspective on constructing ML systems that are both reliable and adaptable, emphasizing their unique nature due to data dependencies.
  - [Building Machine Learning Powered Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/) by Emmanuel Ameisen: This dives into the process of building and deploying ML applications, covering the lifecycle of an ML product.
  - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann: While not exclusively about ML systems, this book provides a comprehensive overview of modern data systems, some of which underpin ML applications.
- **Research Papers**
  - [Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/) by Sculley et al. This paper provides insights into the complexities and challenges of ML systems in production.
  - [150 Successful Machine Learning Models: 6 Lessons Learned at Booking.com](https://blog.kevinhu.me/2021/04/25/25-Paper-Reading-Booking.com-Experiences/bernardi2019.pdf) by Lucas Bernardi et al. This paper contains an analysis on about 150 successful customer facing applications of Machine Learning, developed by dozens of teams in Booking.com, exposed to hundreds of millions of users worldwide and validated through rigorous Randomized Controlled Trials.
- **Online Resources**
  - [Rules of Machine Learning:Best Practices for ML Engineering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml) by Martin Zinkevich. This document is intended to help those with a basic knowledge of machine learning get the benefit of Google's best practices in machine learning. It presents a style for machine learning, similar to the Google C++ Style Guide and other popular guides to practical programming.
  - [Science at Uber: Powering Machine Learning at Uber](https://www.uber.com/en-ES/blog/uber-science-machine-learning-platform/) by Wayne Cunningham. This resource talks about how Uber's machine learning platform, Michelangelo, lets teams across the company train, evaluate, and deploy models that help them forecast a wide range of business metrics.  



## Machine Learning in Organizations
- **Books**
  - [Reliable Machine Learning](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/reliable-machine-learning/9781098106218/) by Cathy Chen et al. This practical book shows data scientists, software and site reliability engineers, product managers, and business owners how to run and establish ML reliably, effectively, and accountably within your organization.



## Causal Inference
- **Books**
  - [Causal Inference in Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v1/continue/9781098140243/) by Matheus Facure. This book explains the largely untapped potential of causal inference for estimating impacts and effects.
- **Research Papers**
  - [Democratizing online controlled experiments at Booking.com](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08217.pdf) by Raphael Lopez Kaufman et al. In this paper they how building a central repository of successes
and failures to allow for knowledge sharing, having a generic and extensible code library which enforces a loose coupling between experimentation and business logic.
- **Online Resources**
